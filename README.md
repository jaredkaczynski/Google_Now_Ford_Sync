# Google_Now_Ford_Sync
A test application to trigger Google Now using Ford Sync

Basically this is something that adds an application that triggers the Google Search application on the android phone it is installed on.

You have to specifically enter the application which ruins the music titles and such which is why I have not worked on this further.
